    "Data is typically classified into two broad types: **qualitative (categorical)** and **quantitative (numerical)**. Here's a breakdown of each type and their associated measurement scales:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Qualitative (Categorical) Data\n",
    "Qualitative data describes qualities or characteristics and is non-numeric. It’s generally used to categorize or label attributes and can’t be measured with numbers in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Qualitative Data\n",
    "   - **Nominal Scale**: Nominal data is the simplest form of categorical data. It represents categories without any inherent order or ranking. Examples include:\n",
    "     - **Gender**: male, female, non-binary\n",
    "     - **Blood type**: A, B, AB, O\n",
    "     - **Marital status**: single, married, divorced, widowed\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Ordinal Scale**: Ordinal data represents categories with a meaningful order or ranking, but the differences between the ranks aren’t consistent or meaningful. Examples include:\n",
    "     - **Survey responses**: agree, neutral, disagree\n",
    "     - **Education levels**: high school, bachelor's, master's, Ph.D.\n",
    "     - **Pain level**: mild, moderate, severe\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Quantitative (Numerical) Data\n",
    "Quantitative data represents quantities and can be measured numerically. This type of data can be used for arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Quantitative Data\n",
    "   - **Interval Scale**: Interval data has ordered, equally spaced intervals between values but lacks a true zero point, which means ratios aren’t meaningful. Examples include:\n",
    "     - **Temperature**: in Celsius or Fahrenheit (0°C does not mean \"no temperature\")\n",
    "     - **IQ scores**: where the difference between scores is meaningful but there’s no true zero\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Ratio Scale**: Ratio data is similar to interval data but includes a true zero point, which allows for the computation of ratios. Examples include:\n",
    "     - **Height**: 0 cm means no height, and a person who is 180 cm tall is twice as tall as someone who is 90 cm.\n",
    "     - **Weight**: 0 kg represents no weight, and 10 kg is twice as much as 5 kg.\n",
    "     - **Income**: where $0 means no income, and $50,000 is half of $100,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **Qualitative Data**: Nominal (unordered categories), Ordinal (ordered categories).\n",
    "- **Quantitative Data**: Interval (ordered with meaningful intervals, no true zero), Ratio (ordered with meaningful intervals and true zero). \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these types and scales helps in choosing the correct statistical methods for data analysis."
