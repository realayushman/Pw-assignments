        "1. What is a parameter?\n",
        "A parameter in Machine Learning refers to variables that are intrinsic to the model and are learned from the data during the training process. These parameters determine the behavior and performance of the model. For example, in a linear regression model, the slope (weight) and intercept (bias) are parameters.\n",
        "Parameters differ from hyperparameters, which are set manually before training (e.g., learning rate or the number of layers in a neural network).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is correlation?\n",
        "Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the extent to which two variables are related. It quantifies the direction and strength of their relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "A positive correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other increases.\n",
        "A negative correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other decreases.\n",
        "A correlation coefficient (r) ranges from -1 to +1:\n",
        "+1: Perfect positive correlation.\n",
        "-1: Perfect negative correlation.\n",
        "0: No correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "Negative correlation occurs when two variables are inversely related. As one variable increases, the other decreases.\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "As the price of a product increases, the demand for the product typically decreases. The correlation coefficient (r) for a negative correlation is between -1 and 0.\n",

        "4. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",

        "The loss value quantifies the error between the model’s predictions and the actual target values. It acts as a feedback mechanism to improve the model during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "A low loss value indicates the model is making accurate predictions.\n",
        "A high loss value suggests the model is not performing well and needs adjustments.\n",
        "The loss value is minimized during training using optimization techniques (e.g., gradient descent).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "Continuous Variables: These are numeric variables that can take any value within a range (e.g., height, weight, temperature).\n",
