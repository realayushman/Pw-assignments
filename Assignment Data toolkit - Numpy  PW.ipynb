    "NumPy is like the backbone of scientific computing in Python. It's built specifically for working with arrays and numbers, making it much more efficient for these tasks than Python’s built-in features. If you're dealing with a lot of data or complex mathematical operations, NumPy is the go-to library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why NumPy is Important:\n",
    "Array Handling: At its core, NumPy is all about working with arrays. Arrays are like Python lists, but way more powerful and faster. You can create 1D, 2D, or even higher-dimensional arrays (think grids of numbers), and perform operations on them all at once, instead of element by element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed and Efficiency:\n",
    "NumPy is fast—much faster than using lists, for example. That's because it’s written in C, so it runs at a lower level, closer to the machine. Plus, it uses memory more efficiently, so you can work with bigger datasets without hogging your system’s resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Math Powerhouse:\n",
    "It has built-in functions for pretty much every mathematical operation you can think of—whether it’s basic stuff like adding and subtracting arrays, or more advanced things like linear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transforms. NumPy lets you do these calculations on entire datasets at once, without writing a bunch of loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Advantages of Using NumPy:\n",
    "Performance Boost: One of the biggest perks is vectorization. Normally, in Python, you’d need loops to work on each element of a list. But with NumPy, you can perform operations on entire arrays in one shot. This is not only more efficient but way faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Efficiency:\n",
    "Python lists are flexible, but that flexibility comes with overhead. NumPy arrays store data more compactly, so they use less memory, especially when working with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcasting:\n",
    "This is a fancy way of saying that NumPy knows how to automatically match the shapes of arrays when you’re performing operations. If one array is smaller, it stretches it out behind the scenes to match the bigger array, so you don’t have to worry about dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Works Well with Other Libraries:\n",
    "NumPy is the foundation for a lot of other Python libraries like Pandas (for data analysis) or SciPy (for more complex scientific calculations). When you use these libraries, you’re usually dealing with NumPy arrays under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Datasets:\n",
    "If you’re working with huge datasets (think millions of data points), Python’s lists might slow you down or eat up too much memory. NumPy can handle that kind of workload with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "How NumPy Enhances Python:\n",
    "Python by itself isn't built for heavy numerical calculations. Lists are great for general use but slow when you start doing lots of math with them. NumPy steps in and makes things faster by turning Python into a high-performance tool for working with numbers. Plus, it lets you do things like matrix operations or calculus that would otherwise be much harder and slower in plain Python."

    "Axis Support:\n",

    "You just need the simple arithmetic mean of the data.\n",
    "You don’t have weights or don’t need to worry about weighting elements differently.\n",

    "\n",
    "You need to calculate a weighted average, where certain elements in the data should contribute more (or less) to the final result.\n",

    "Functionality of array_split() Method in NumPy\n",
    "The array_split() method in NumPy is used to divide an array into multiple sub-arrays along a specified axis. This method is particularly useful when you need to partition your data into smaller segments for processing or analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features of array_split():\n",
    "Splitting Along an Axis:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify the axis along which to split the array. By default, it splits along the first axis (axis=0), which is the row direction for 2D arrays.\n",
    "Uneven Splits:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike split(), which requires the array to be evenly divisible by the number of splits, array_split() can handle uneven splits. If the array cannot be evenly divided, it will distribute the remaining elements across the sub-arrays.\n",
    "Return Type:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns a list of sub-arrays, each containing the specified number of elements.\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "ary: The input array to be split.\n",
    "indices_or_sections: The number of splits or the specific indices at which to split the array.\n",
    "axis: The axis along which to split (default is 0).\n",
    "Handling Uneven Splits\n",
    "When you specify a number of splits that does not evenly divide the size of the array along the specified axis, array_split() will create as many equal-sized sub-arrays as possible and distribute the leftover elements across the resulting sub-arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you try to split an array of size 10 into 3 parts, array_split() will create two arrays of size 3 and one array of size 4.\n"
