    "Generators offer several advantages over regular functions, especially when dealing with large datasets or continuous streams of data. The primary benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Memory Efficiency:*  \n",
    "   Generators are more memory-efficient than regular functions because they yield values one at a time, instead of generating and storing the entire sequence in memory. This makes them ideal for working with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Lazy Evaluation:*  \n",
    "   Generators produce values only when they are needed (lazy evaluation), which means they don’t compute values until requested by the next() function or a loop. This leads to efficient performance, especially in situations where not all values in the sequence are required at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Improved Performance:*  \n",
    "   Since generators generate items on the fly and maintain their state between iterations, they often lead to faster execution when compared to functions that return lists or other collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Infinite Sequences:*  \n",
    "   Generators can handle infinite sequences (such as generating an endless stream of data) because they don't store the data in memory. Regular functions would crash or exhaust memory when trying to generate an infinite sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *State Retention:*  \n",
    "   Generators automatically retain their state between successive calls to yield, meaning there's no need to manage the state manually in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. *Simpler Code:*  \n",
