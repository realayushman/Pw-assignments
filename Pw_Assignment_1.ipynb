    "1. Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "   Arithmetic operators are used for basic mathematical calculations:\n",
    "   - Addition (+): Combines two values (e.g., 5 + 3 results in 8).\n",
    "   - Subtraction (-): Subtracts one value from another (e.g., 10 - 7 results in 3).\n",
    "   - Multiplication (*): Multiplies two values (e.g., 4 * 6 results in 24).\n",
    "   - Division (/): Divides one value by another, giving a floating-point result (e.g., 15 / 2 results in 7.5).\n",
    "   - Floor Division (//): Similar to division but only returns the integer part of the quotient (e.g., 15 // 2 results in 7).\n",
    "   - Modulus (%): Provides the remainder after division (e.g., 15 % 4 results in 3).\n",
    "   - Exponentiation (**): Raises a value to the power of another (e.g., 2 ** 3 results in 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Comparison (Relational) Operators\n",
    "   Comparison operators evaluate relationships between values, returning a Boolean (True or False):\n",
    "   - Equal to (==): Checks if two values are equal (e.g., 5 == 5 returns True).\n",
    "   - Not equal to (!=): Checks if two values are not equal (e.g., 5 != 3 returns True).\n",
    "   - Greater than (>): Checks if the first value is greater than the second (e.g., 7 > 3 returns True).\n",
    "   - Less than (<): Checks if the first value is less than the second (e.g., 3 < 7 returns True).\n",
    "   - Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second (e.g., 4 >= 4 returns True).\n",
    "   - Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the first value is less than or equal to the second (e.g., 3 <= 5 returns True).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Logical Operators\n",
    "   Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:\n",
    "   - and: Returns True if both conditions are true (e.g True and False results in False).\n",
    "   - or: Returns True if at least one condition is true (e.g True or False results in True).\n",
    "   - not: Reverses the Boolean value of a condition (e.g not True results in False).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Bitwise Operators\n",
    "   Bitwise operators work at the binary level:\n",
    "   - AND (&): Compares each bit of two integers and returns a new integer where the bits are 1 only if both corresponding bits are 1 (e.g., 5 & 3 results in 1 in binary).\n",
    "   - OR (|): Compares each bit of two integers and returns 1 if either bit is 1 (e.g., 5 | 3 results in 7 in binary).\n",
    "   - NOT (~): Inverts all the bits of a number (e.g., ~5 flips the bits of 5).\n",
    "   - Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits of the number to the left, adding zeros from the right (e.g., 5 << 1 shifts bits left).\n",
    "   - Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits to the right, removing bits from the right (e.g., 5 >> 1 shifts bits right).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Assignment Operators\n",
    "   Assignment operators assign values to variables, often in combination with an operation:\n",
    "   - Simple Assignment (=): Assigns a value directly (e.g., x = 5).\n",
    "   - Add and Assign (+=): Adds a value to a variable and assigns the result to that variable (e.g., x += 3).\n",
    "   - Subtract and Assign (-=), Multiply and Assign (*=), Divide and Assign (/=), Floor Divide and Assign (//=), Modulus and Assign (%=), Exponentiate and Assign (**=): Each of these operators performs the corresponding arithmetic operation and then assigns the result to the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Identity Operators\n",
    "   Identity operators compare the memory locations of two objects:\n",
    "   - is: Returns True if both operands refer to the same object (e.g., a is b is True if a and b reference the same object).\n",
    "   - is not: Returns True if the operands refer to different objects (e.g., a is not b is True if a and b reference different objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Membership Operators\n",
    "   Membership operators test whether a value is a member of a sequence:\n",
    "   - in: Returns True if a value exists within a sequence (e.g., 'a' in 'apple' returns True).\n",
    "   - not in: Returns True if a value does not exist within a sequence (e.g., 'b' not in 'apple' returns True)"
